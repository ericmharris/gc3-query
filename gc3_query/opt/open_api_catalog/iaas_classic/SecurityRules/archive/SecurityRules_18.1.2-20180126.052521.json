If you don't specify match criteria in the security rule, all traffic in the specified direction is permitted.<p>When you create a security rule with a specified direction, say ingress, you should also create a corresponding security rule for the opposite direction - in this case, egress. This is generally required to ensure that when traffic is permitted in one direction, responses or acknowledgement packets in the opposite direction are also permitted.<p>When you create a security rule, you specify the ACL that it belongs to. ACLs apply to vNICsets. You can apply multiple ACLs to a vNICset and you can apply each ACL to multiple vNICsets.

The primary function of security rules is to help identify the type of traffic to be allowed in the IP network."
