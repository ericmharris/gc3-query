  description: A security rule defines network access over a specified protocol between
    instances in two security lists, or from a set of external hosts (an IP list)
    to instances in a security list.<p>Security rules tie the security list, security
    IP list, and security application entities together.<p>You can create, delete,
    update, and view security rules using the HTTP requests listed below. For more
