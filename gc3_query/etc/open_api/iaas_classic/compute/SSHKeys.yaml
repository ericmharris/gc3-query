  description: To connect to an instance using SSH, you must associate it with one
    or more SSH public keys. You must first generate the required SSH key pairs, by
    using a tool such as <code>ssh-keygen</code>, and then upload the public keys
    to Compute Classic.<p>You can add, delete, update, and view SSH public keys using
    the HTTP requests listed below. For instructions to generate SSH key pairs, see
