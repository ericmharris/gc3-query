                Oracle Identity Cloud Service.</li></ul><p><b>Service instance clones:</b>
                You can create a clone of an existing Oracle Java Cloud Service instance,
                but you must first create a snapshot of the service instance you want
                to clone. See <a href='api-snapshots.html'>Snapshots REST Endpoints</a>.
                You also need to create clones of the infrastructure schema and any
                application schema Database Cloud Service database deployments associated
                with the source Java Cloud Service instance you intend to clone. <p>Cloning
                is not supported for service instances that were created before release
                17.4.1. For service instances that were created before release 17.4.1,
                you can take snapshots but you cannot create clones from those snapshots.
                To find out whether a service instance was created before release
                17.4.1, send a <code>GET</code> REST API request to the service instance
                (described in <a href='http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=jcs_mrest_getone'>View
                a Service Instance</a>). In the data that the API request returns,
                search for the line, <code>"provisionEngine":"Metadata_<i>x</i>_<i>y</i>"</code>
                (for example, <code>"provisionEngine":"Metadata_1_0"</code>). If the
                line exists, the service instance was created using release 17.4.1
                or higher. If the line does not exist, the instance was created using
                a release before 17.4.1. See <a href='http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=JSCUG-GUID-28871F48-A458-41C1-86F8-566ED842C3D5'

                Oracle Java Cloud Service</i>.<p><b>Heap sizes:</b> The heap sizes
                for the Managed Server processes are determined automatically by the
                compute shape you specify for the WebLogic component type. See <a
                href='http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=JSCUG-GUID-A3190691-7808-4E14-8873-2FA205F58134'

                Instances</a> in <i>Administering Oracle Java Cloud Service</i>. When
                creating a service instance, you can define your own JVM memory configuration
                if you don't want to use the computed values, and you can customize
                the Managed Server JVM arguments configuration.<p><b>Database software
                release:</b> Oracle Database 18c is not supported in Oracle Java Cloud
                Service. As for Oracle Database 12.2, only Oracle Java Cloud Service
                instances based on WebLogic Server 12.2.1 fully support using the
                Database 12.2 version for the infrastructure database (to contain
                the Oracle schemas that are required for Oracle Java Cloud Service).
                <p><b>Exadata database and IP reservations:</b> (Not supported on
                Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) If you plan to use an Oracle Exadata
                database with an Oracle Java Cloud Service instance <i>in an account
                where regions are not supported</i>, see the My Oracle Support document
                titled <i>How to Request Authorized IPs for Provisioning a Java Cloud
                Service with Database Exadata Cloud Service</i> (MOS Note 2163568.1)
                to submit a request for IP reservations. You must obtain IP reservations
                for the Managed Servers you are going to provision before creating
                the service instance. The number of IP reservations you need corresponds
                to the number of Managed Server nodes you want to provision in the
                cluster.<p><b>AppToCloud migration:</b> The AppToCloud infrastructure
                enables you to quickly migrate existing Java applications and their
                supporting Oracle WebLogic Server resources to Oracle Java Cloud Service.
                To import an on-premises WebLogic Server domain configuration and
                its deployed applications into Oracle Java Cloud Service, you must
                create a service instance with the appropriate AppToCloud artifacts
                that have been uploaded to cloud object storage. Before you can create
                such a service instance, there are certain prerequisites that must
                be met, and certain on-premises tasks and Oracle Cloud tasks that
                must be performed. See <a href='http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=JSCUG-GUID-9873F59C-09B7-4F89-8FC6-B889056D2442'

                After performing the required tasks, to associate the service instance
                with the AppToCloud artifacts when you create the instance, you must
