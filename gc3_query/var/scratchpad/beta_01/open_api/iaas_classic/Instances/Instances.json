The instance is restarted without losing any of the instance data or configuration.<p>You can also update the value for the <code>tags</code> parameter. If the instance is already shut down, you can also change the value of the <code>shape</code> parameter.<p>Shutting down an instance is useful when you've created multiple instances in a single orchestration. In this case, stopping the instance orchestration would cause all instances to be deleted. If you want to stop one or more instances, while letting other instances in the same orchestration run, you can shut down the required instances individually.<p>Here's what happens when you shut down an instance:<p>* The instance ID is retained and reused when you restart the instance. So the multipart instance name doesn't change. This is useful in case the instance name is referenced by other objects, such as storage attachments.<p>* For instances created using orchestrations v1, the instance orchestration shows an error. However, even if the HA policy specified is active, the instance isn't automatically re-created.<p>* The resources associated with that instance, such as storage volumes and IP reservations, are freed up and can be used by other instances if required. However, if you attempt to restart an instance, ensure that the required resources are available, otherwise the instance can't restart and will go into an error state.<p>* The private IP address on the shared network is released. If you restart the instance later, it is allotted a private IP address afresh. So the private IP address of the instance on the shared network is likely to change.<p>* Dynamically allocated IP addresses on IP networks are also released. So if you start the instance later, dynamically allocated IP addresses on IP networks are also likely to change. Static private IP addresses that are allocated to interfaces in the instance orchestration won't change.<p>* Any changes that you'd made to the instance in Compute Classic after the instance was created will be lost. For example, if you added the instance to security lists, attached storage volumes to the instance, or detached and attached an IP reservation, you'll need to make those changes again. The instance will be restarted with the resources that are associated with it in the instance orchestration.<p><b>Note:</b> Changes made to the instance by logging in to the instance won't be lost, however, as these are preserved on the persistent storage volumes attached to the instance.
