    "description" : "A security list is a group of one or more instances that you can specify as the destination or source in a security rule. Instances within a security list can communicate fully with one another on all ports. When you attach an instance to a security list, the inbound and outbound policies defined in the security list are applicable to that instance. All instances within a security list can communicate fully with one another on all protocols and ports.<p>While creating an instance, if you do not attach it to any security list, the instance gets attached automatically to the predefined <code>/Compute-<em>identity_domain</em>/default/default</code> security list, which has the inbound policy set to <code>DENY</code> and the outbound policy set to <code>PERMIT</code>.<p>You can create, delete, update, and view security lists using the HTTP requests listed below.

All instances within a security list can communicate fully with one another on all protocols and ports.<p>While creating an instance, if you do not attach it to any security list, the instance gets attached automatically to the predefined <code>/Compute-<em>identity_domain</em>/default/default</code> security list, which has the inbound policy set to <code>DENY</code> and the outbound policy set to <code>PERMIT</code>.<p>You can create, delete, update, and view security lists using the HTTP requests listed below.
